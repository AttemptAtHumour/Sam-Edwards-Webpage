								<h2>MEET SAM.</h2>
							</header><p>A professional media producer with a passion for impact and novelty, Sam Edwards has been creating digital video since he learned how to work iMovie. Now, with years of production experience under his belt and a 7.0 GPA from the University of Newcastle, he’s bringing a fresh edge to media and content in the digital age.
							<p>Sam first started working in content creation in 2020, operating the YouTube channels for local business Hunter Christian Church during the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting a Bachelor of Communication the following year, Sam worked on multiple feature films during his academic career including as a production assistant in Stu McBratney’s <i>Strangers In A Carpark</i> and as cinematographer Tyler Beckley’s <i>Under The Red</i>. Many of his creative works received awards from the University faculty, including Best Music Video for <i>More Than Friends</i> with Cooks And Bakers, Best Short Film for <i>Grown-Up</i> and Best Visual Effects for <i>Fortune And Glory.</i>

							<p>Professionally, Sam also consulted with Cattleyard Productions developing an advertising campaign for music festival <i>Fresh Produce</i> during the pandemic, and was commissioned alongside a student team from the University to create promotional video campaigns which resulted in <i>The Courier</i>. His postgraduate work also includes directing a sponsorship video for the University’s RAPID program, as well as working with the NUTeams division of the University’s Engineering School to devise promotion for their industry partners - allowing him to work with Australian industry giants like Sandvik, Banlaw and Ausgrid across NSW.
							<p>After graduating at the end of 2023, the following year saw Sam take on his greatest challenge yet - writing and directing a feature-length murder-mystery film entitled <i>To The Tooth</i>. It also saw him take on a position as Digital Marketing Consultant for Hunter Scrubs, which involved web development, design and optimisation alongside his usual skill set of video production and media-making.
							<p>In his spare time, Sam enjoys watching movies, writing music, solving puzzles and figuring out his next big creative project.
